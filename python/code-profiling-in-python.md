# Code Profiling in Python

I came across a good article on python profiling that explored the use case of
speeding up tests.  I applied this to the test suite of umldappy and got a
speedup from 130 seconds to 44 seconds locally with not too much effort.  It
feels good!  A nice, quick win for the better.
